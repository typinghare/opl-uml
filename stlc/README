Description of Files:
---------------------
  - ast.ml    
      Defines the datatypes for the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and values.

  - eval.ml
      The interpreter for the ASTs. 

  - helper.ml
      Functions that should be helpful for implementing your solutions.

  - lexer.mll
  - parser.mly
      A lexer and parser for the source language.

  - pprint.ml
      A pretty printer for the ASTs.

  - main.ml
      The top level code that parses in an input file and runs the
      interpreter/typechecker.

  - examples
      Some test programs in the source language. You should really try
      your solution out on all of these examples, and also come up
      with some of your own. There's even a little script (test.sh) to 
      help you try your solution against some test cases. The script will
      say that your test case fails if it doesn't exactly match the
      "gold standard" output. 

What to do:
----------

Complete eval function from eval.ml. More comments inlined in the file.


How to compile:
---------------

  If you have make installed, you can simply type "make" at the
  command line. Successful compilation will produce an executable file called "lam".

How to run:
-----------

./lam <file>
  - attempts to  evaluate the program in <file>

What to submit:
---------------

Submit eval.ml under the gradescope assignment "Practice STLC"
