This is an implementation of an interpreter for the stack programming language. We give the students just the compiled modules (so that they can't see the source code for the implementation).

Run "make" to compile the interpreter, and also to copy the compiled modules to the interpreter subdirectory.

Run "make release" to zip up the interpreter directory into the file interpreter.zip, which is what should be released to the students.

Tested on OCaml versions 4.14.1 and 5.1.1.
